To execute a command, use the following syntax:

```

For example, to ask "hello?" using YGKA, you can use the following command:

```sh
ygka "hello?"
```

You can also use YGKA with Unix pipeline. For example, to ask "what is this file?" while viewing the contents of a text file, you can use the following command:

```sh
cat textfile.txt | ygka "what is this file?"
```

## Advanced Settings ðŸ› 

By default, YGKA is configured to use either the official_chatgpt or reverse_engineered_chatgpt language model. To change the language model, modify the `~/.ygka_config.json` file as follows:

```json
{
    ...
    "language_model": <language model of your preference>, //"official_chatgpt" or "reverse_engineered_chatgpt"
    "openai_api_key": <your OpenAI API key>
}
```

Here, you can specify the language model of your preference and add your OpenAI API key.
